===CHANGELOG===

==V0.2 ALPHA==
FEATURES:
- The old AnimLoader has been removed and replaced by a general ResourceLoader. The ResourceLoader caches all Remote2D files as well as all Textures.  This provides a substantial speedup when loading textures, prefabs, maps, and more.
- The file extension specification has been changed to be easier to tell if it is XML or Binary.  EVERY R2D file must end with either ".xxx.xml" or ".xxx.bin", where ".xxx" is the extension that would be used in a previous Remote2D release.  For example, in this release you could use ".entity.xml" or ".entity.bin" for prefab files.  You can NOT use ".entity" as with previous releases.
- Materials were changed to add repetition and scaling parameters.
- UV data was also added to Materials and Animations
- All example files / programs were changed to conform to the new specifications
FIXES:
- Fixed a bug where using the default "Save..." dialog wouldn't remember the current path until you save at least once (NOT when you load for the first time)

==V0.1.3.1 ALPHA==
FEATURES:
- Added an override to GuiInGame for Remote2DGame instances
FIXES:
- Fixed a bug where an error would be thrown when trying to edit an entity’s texture
- Fixed a bug on windows and linux where the shift up-arrow wouldn’t show in the editor top menu
- Fixed a bug where two different menu options were assigned SHFT-CTRL-S.  Now that option goes to “Save As…”
- Fixed a bug where an error would be thrown when applying blank text fields.
- Fixed a bug that would cause tomfoolery whenever an entity was removed from the list during a tick.
- Fixed a bug where clicking outside of the browser or the hierarchy would still select elements that weren’t showing due to scrolling.

==V0.1.3 ALPHA==
FEATURES:
- Added prefabs.  Prefabs are a way to save a commonly-used entity to a file, and reuse them later.  Additionally you can edit the prefab file directly and change all entities associated with it.

==V0.1.2.1 ALPHA==
FIXES:
- Hotfix to fix the text fields in the Open/Save map dialogs not working.

==V0.1.2 ALPHA==
FEATURES:
- Added a debug tool in Renderer.class that allows you to see all matrix operations currently pushed to the stack
- Adding Components is now undoable
- Added a test component for testing Entity pointers
- Added Open Map / Save Map dialogs, as well as a “Save Map As...” option
- Saving a map reminds you if the file exists and is being overwritten
FIXES:
- Removed parenting temporarily, as it was buggy and didn’t work
- Fixed buggy rotation
- The inspector is now slightly more stable, using Entity UUIDs instead of the Entity’s index in the EntityList for storage
- Fixed Entity pointers not being updated when the Entity that is pointed to is changed.
- Fixed a crash when saving a file if user-defined attributes are unavailable for some reason (NOTE: if this does occur the engine will have to guess if XML is used)
- Fixed a bug where the map would still zoom in and out when you scroll even if a window is currently selected
- Fixed a bug where R2DFileUtility.getJarPath() would not be formatted in UTF-8 (ex. spaces would be formatted as “%20”)
- Fixed a bug in the browser which wouldn’t load anything outside of Eclipse
MISC:
- Updated changelog formatting

==V0.1.1 ALPHA==
FEATURES:
- Changed build from packaging external jars to extracting them, allowing you to use the jar for both an API and a Runnable test jar.
FIXES:
- Hotfix fixing a fatal bug that doesn’t allow the editor to open
- Hotfix fixing a fatal error on macs if no icon is specified

==V1.0 ALPHA==
